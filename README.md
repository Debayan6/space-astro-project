This repo details the comprehensive analysis and modeling process used to study exoplanet transit data. The subsequent code snippets demonstrate various aspects of the workflow, including data
processing, transit modeling, and analysis with different tools and techniques.
The analysis begins by importing essential packages for data manipulation, visualization, and light curve analysis. We then define key inputs such as the TOI (TESS Object of Interest) ID, observational sectors, orbital period, and transit depth. This is followed by creating TRICERATOPS targets and setting aperture arrays for specific sectors, which aids in understanding light curve structure.
Next, the analysis delves into transit depths and False Positive Probabilities (FPP), providing insights into identifying potential exoplanet candidates and assessing the reliability of transit events. The code also addresses the extraction and plotting of pixel locations, and important step for visualizing the target field and assessing contaminators. The modeling process uses Juliet to fit transit data, extracting key planetary parameters and validating the transit model. This stage includes plotting results to visualize the observed light curve, the best-fit transit model, and residuals. Finally, additional analysis is
performed to understand key parameters like transit duration, semi-major axis, and insolation flux, leading to comprehensive visual representations of the target star and planet. With this structured approach, the code sections offer a thorough examination of exoplanet transit data, covering everything from light curve processing to the final analysis and modeling of transit events.
